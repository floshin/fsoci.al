  <h2>About fsocial</h2>

  <p>fsocial takes a stand against established 'social media', 
    which are asocial in design. We give a fuck about their 
    addictive and harmful mechanisms and think that social 
    media has to be non-commercial and free of ads on 
    principle. We encourage people who have something to 
    express to have their own website instead of a social 
    media profile. To simplify this process we work on an 
    app automating website creation and give the control 
    back to the host: Yourself.</p>

  <p>Public websites are presented in a feed in form of a simple index webpage, 
    like an illustrated list of all those who decide to boycott 
    established social media to join the fsocial network.</p>

  <p>If you want your already existing webpage to be included, 
    all you have to do is to comply to basic standards of 
    non-abusive webdesign.</p> 
  
  <p>More coming soon.</p>
