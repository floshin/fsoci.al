Social media sucks. fsocial sucks less. 

We are trying to organise free, open source, decentralised self-hosting or git-hosting of social media profiles (in form of simple static web pages), serving as an index for people to find each other and share images (like a picture feed) or text (like a blog) or both; to give control back to the user.  

Read as you wish: Free or fuck established social media.
