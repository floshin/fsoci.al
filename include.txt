"Show the world, that you give a fuck about their 
addictive and harmful platforms and rather have 
your own website to free social media from its 
current slavery."

"Whats wrong with established social media?"
A picture button in gog-style, then a little article and links/studies/facebook papers etc.

"fsocial app"
here show the mockup I did before.

Two sections:
"Featured" (important pages we want to make aware of, like GOS)
which is like one or two smaller rows of stuff at the top and then 
in an extra section underneath just the feed without any regular order
see gog for some design inspiration. 

we need a light/dark design switch here, AT LEAST include it like GOS, automatic dependent on the OS settings.


git about:
A free and decentralised non-asocial network in development, that attempts to give the control back to the people, either by means of self-hosting or by automation of git-hosting, presenting an index of those profiles in an app.
